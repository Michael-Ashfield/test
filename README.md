## Project description
* The CSS was developed using Sass, passed through a normaliser during compliation to allow it to be more compatable with older browsers.
* An attempt at using a responcive grid was made however mutliple issues rendered the grid (that worked in tetsing on CodePen https://codepen.io/Michael-Ashfield/pen/BmjWvg) useless, so a classic box-model float method was used sucessfully.
* Developed on Cloud9 IDE.
* The CSS for the project is in css/main.css
* The main SCSS for the page is in scss/pages/home.scss while scss/main.scss is the sass file that is compiled, importing the variables, home and normalise files.

## Known issues:
* "Learn more" button does not dissapear when the expandable area is opened. Multiple attempts made to fix this were unsucessful, despite it being there the buttons still function properly in opening and closing the main area.
* SVGs are wrong colour, attempts were made to change the colour despite multiple attemps. I could have attempted to try to change the stroke colour in the SVG files themselves but decided against it, restricting all my work to HTML and CSS.
* The download icon on the tour times image sometimes is misaligned on some resolutions, multiple attempts to repair this issue were unsucessful.
